Examples for preparing .remap files.

prepare-grch37.pl is a work-in-progress script that attempts to create remap files from the GRCh37 reference.

Arguments are: source directory, destination directory, and (optional) flank (default is 150)

It expects a source directory listing like:

GRCh37/
GRCh37.p1/
GRCh37.p2/
... etc

If it doesn't find a directory like this, it should fail verbosely. However, if the script merley prints 'Done' without any status messages, it most likely could not understand the layout of the source directory.

The destination directory should be empty. Behavior for non-empty destination directories is undefined.

Please note that this script will use several gigabytes in /tmp.

This script has difficulty working with patches to alts and unlocalized scaffolds in the primary assembly, and will warn the user with errors such as 'Parse error: Did not find accession 'GL000192.1' in any fasta files' and 'Could not find placement for patch 'JH636052.1-GL000192.1'.

Although this script tries to catch any errors it encounters, it has not been thoroughly tested.
